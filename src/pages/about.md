## I turn sound into great music and film score

<div class="about-body">

I am a working composer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I completed a Master's
degree in Film Scoring at the New Zealand School of Music. During my years
studying I have become experienced in composing high quality music in a rapid
time frame for advertising, short films, feature films, and artistic projects.

My sharp work flow and passionate work ethic allows for an incredibly short turn
around, giving you more options, more time, and a stress free experience without
sacrificing quality.
