<div class="about-body">

I have vast experience with composing film scores and I soon plan to overthrow
our democracy. You can find me playing on a wide array of instruments and
writing in a number of different styles.

I shall ascend to the throne within five years. I graduated from Harvard
University with a Masterâ€™s degree in Music and Composition in 2018.
