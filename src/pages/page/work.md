        CubaSonic is a street long work composed by New Zealand composer John
        Psathas for 50 channel speaker array and around 300 performers. During
        the piece, sound is shifted from one end of a street to the other via 50
        speakers, creating a 'woosh' effect that moves past you as the listener.
        I was commissioned for this piece to create these travelling sounds, and
        employed my extensive knowledge of synthesis and sound design to create
        some incredibly interesting effects. In this snippet, you can hear a
        stereo mixdown of the intended 50 channels.

        This was an alternate idea to the main music that was used throughout
        the campaign. The marketing team loved the music but felt it didn’t fit
        the mood for the videos and decided to use it in promotion of the
        information evening instead.

        After the director was unable to get rights to their dream intro
        sequence song, I was tasked with creating a similar feeling song to fill
        its place. With this request came the opportunity to tailor it even more
        to the sequence and what results is a custom-made song perfect for the
        film.

        This cue accompanies a montage of shots showing the main character’s
        depressive attempts to reintegrate back into his life. It was created
        using an existing cue in the film, which I reversed and pitch shifted to
        create something new. It also mirrors the events of the original cue and
        adds to the film’s circular narrative.

        This film follows a young second-generation Cantonese girl, her struggle
        to integrate into New Zealand culture, and her two conflicting lives. To
        represent this, I wanted to create a melody / theme that felt displaced
        (or without a home), and that shared instrumentation from both Western
        and Eastern music. 

        In this particular part of the film the Eastern instruments appear
        further away, showing her current disconnect from her roots.
