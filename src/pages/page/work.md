        Music used for Radio Promotion of an information evening at Victoria
        University.
      description: >
        This was an alternate idea to the main music that was used throughout
        the campaign. The marketing team loved the music but felt it didn’t fit
        the mood for the videos and decided to use it in promotion of the
        information evening instead.

        Song composed for the intro sequence to the feature length romantic
        comedy 'Hang Time'.
      description: >
        After the director was unable to get rights to their dream intro
        sequence song, I was tasked with creating a similar feeling song to fill
        its place. With this request came the opportunity to tailor it even more
        to the sequence and what results is a custom-made song perfect for the
        film.

        Cue composed for the feature length romantic comedy 'Hang Time'.

        This cue appears towards the end of the film during a scene where the
        main characters lie in a river to ease their hangovers. This point is
        also a key developmental motif in the characters’ evolution.

        Cue composed for the gripping thriller short ‘Hark’.
      description: >
        This cue accompanies a montage of shots showing the main character’s
        depressive attempts to reintegrate back into his life. It was created
        using an existing cue in the film, which I reversed and pitch shifted to
        create something new. It also mirrors the events of the original cue and
        adds to the film’s circular narrative.

        Thematic Material composed for the short drama 'Red Envelopes'.
      description: >
        This film follows a young second-generation Cantonese girl, her struggle
        to integrate into New Zealand culture, and her two conflicting lives. To
        represent this, I wanted to create a melody / theme that felt displaced
        (or without a home), and that shared instrumentation from both Western
        and Eastern music. 

        In this particular part of the film the Eastern instruments appear
        further away, showing her current disconnect from her roots.

        My debut solo album release. Music was composed as I was first starting
        to write for film.

        I wanted to create a few simple ideas to stretch over an hour, and that
        would slowly descend into a sonic hypnotic psychosis before emerging
        triumphantly on the other side. The title ‘Discovery’ refers to the
        discovery one goes through in their early twenties as they learn to live
        life independently from their parents.

        I wanted to create an album with strong sonic characteristics that would
        educate people on doing their part to encourage bee re-population. All
        proceeds are donated to various save the bee charities.
