- change scrollbar?
- landing image needs correction to look like figma version - exposure, contrast etc.
- add menu


find a way to make the . of NICK VEALE stay in the same position relative to the image - maybe wrap them in the same div and choose the absolute positioning or margin/padding between them? This will make the spacing the same

do same thing for the paragraph - so it's in line with the . in NICK VEALE.


graphql query for picture on certain page { path: { eq: $path } } ? so each page doesnt have to perform query that isnt for that page

find out how to get midpoint of div then rotate off that - (x or y - midpoint pixel) * a number
make it so hovering over text on landing doesnt interfere with picture hover
